# THIS FILE SHOULD ALWAYS BE EMPTY!
# ------------------------------------
# It still exists only for one stupid purpose, to make ibazel happy!
# TL,DR: ibazel currently requires a WORKSPACE file to determine the
# root of your Bazel workspace â€” it does not yet support Bzlmod-only
# (i.e., MODULE.bazel-only) workspaces.
